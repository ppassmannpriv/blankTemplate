# Blank Template #

### Shopware v4 ###

---

So I got extremely annoyed by the standard emotion template in shopware and the fact I've been building off of those. For templating a custom design in shopware, the emotion stuff just sucks a bit. They are great on their own or with little tweaking! For total customness it just has too much bloat. So I got around to cleaning it out a bit and also removing some of the weird positioning in the index.tpl

I'll start to complete this and make it a little bit more easy to grasp, so templating off of this will be easier and more "custom"
